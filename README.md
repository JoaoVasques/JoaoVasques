# Hello!

I'm Joao and I'm passionate about building high quality and reliable Data systems. I like solving complex problems with a correct first approach with simple and elegant and durable designs.

I have experience with Kafka, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Postgres, RabbitMQ, REST and gRPC APIs, Protobufs, Pandas and Spark. These days I use Python and Go as my main programming languages. I have a passion for Functional Programming namely Clojure and Scala.

Emacs power user. Spaces instead of tabs.
